          The history of Mahjong is relatively short, only being developed towards the end of the
          Qing Dynasty in the mid-1800's. Mahjong was originally called máquè (麻雀) which means
          "sparrow", in reference to the clacking sound the tiles make when shuffled, which sounds
          like the chirping of birds. The game was developed by a group of scholars and military
          officers who were looking for a way to pass the time. It quickly spread throughout China
          and became popular with the general public.

          The game was originally played with cards, but was later adapted to use tiles. The game
          was further refined in the early 20th century by a group of businessmen in Shanghai

          It's popularity continued to grow and by the early 1900's, Mahjong had become a national
          pastime. The influence of Mahjong on Chinese culture is so great it is often called one of
          the "Four Great Inventions of China".

          The game was brought to the United States in the 1920's and was popularized by Joseph P.
          Babcock, who published a book on the rules of the game. The game was further popularized
          by the National Mah Jongg League, which was founded in 1937. The game was also brought to
          Japan in the early 20th century, where it was adapted to suit Japanese tastes and became
          known as Riichi Mahjong.
