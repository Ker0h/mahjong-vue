    The game starts with the tiles being shuffled and built into four walls in the center of the
    table. Each wall is 18 tiles long and 2 tiles high. The walls are then pushed together to form a
    square. Each of the players recieves 13 tiles and the dealer recieves 14 tiles. The dealer then
    discards a tile to start the game.
