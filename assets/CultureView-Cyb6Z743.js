For example, one should not tap someone on the shoulder during the game, as this might disrupt their winning streak, even across multiple rounds. On the contrary, it is believed that someone can &#39;wash away&#39; bad luck. So player can often be seen visiting the toilet after a series of losses, just to wash their hands. Also, it is considered bad luck to have books on or near a Mahjong table as the words for &#39;book&#39; (書/Shū) and &#39;to lose&#39; (失去/Shīqù) sound somewhat similiar in Chinese. Lastly, in a similiar vein, one should never discard four &#39;West&#39; tiles after one another, as the words for &#39;four&#39; (四/Sì), &#39;West&#39; (西/Xī) and &#39;death&#39; (死/Sǐ) sound the same in Chinese. </p></div><h2 data-v-87746bdf>Gambling Culture</h2><div data-v-87746bdf><p data-v-87746bdf> Even though currently the Chinese government is more lenient towards gambling than it was during the time of Mao, it is still illegal. That&#39;s why Chinese citizens will often play Mahjong for money in secret, or in a more public setting, but without money involved. Visiting a Mahjong parlor in on of the &#39;Special Administrative Regions&#39; (SAR) of China, like Macau or Hong Kong, is also quite popular. <br data-v-87746bdf> One of the reasons Mahjong is still popular today is because it&#39;s a very social game. People sit across from one another and the scrambling and dividing of tiles takes significantly longer than with cards during a card game, allowing for conversations to more easily come up. <br data-v-87746bdf> Most importantly however, is that gambling as a whole is just an unbeatable concept in China. The prospect of relatively quick and &#39;easy&#39; riches is just too tempting for many people to resist. And the gathering of wealth and as such, well being, is one of the most important parts of modern Chinese culture. <br data-v-87746bdf> As they say during New Years: &quot;恭喜發財！&quot; (Gōngxǐ fācái!) which means &quot;Congratulations and be prosperous!&quot;, or more literally: &quot;Let&#39;s get rich and be prosperous!&quot;. </p></div></div>',1),u=[l];function f(b,m){return n(),i("div",h,u)}const v=o(d,[["render",f],["__scopeId","data-v-87746bdf"]]);export{v as default};
