    </ul>
  </div>

<h3>Building a winning hand</h3>
<p>A winning hand consists of four sets and a pair. A set can be a Pong, a Kong, or a Chow.</p>

<h4>Drawing a tile</h4>
<p>
    A player must draw a tile from the start of the wall and add it to their hand. <br />
    The player must then choose a tile to discard from their hand.
  </p>

<h4>Pong</h4>
<p>
    A Pong is a set of three identical tiles. A player can form a Pong by taking a tile from the
    wall or by forming one with a tile that is being discarded by another player. <br />
    A Pong that is formed this way must be shown to the other players, whilst a Pong that is formed
    by taking a tile from the wall does not need to be shown.
  </p>

<h4>Chow</h4>
<p>
    A Chow is a set of three consecutive tiles in the same suit. A player can form a Chow by taking
    a tile from the wall or by forming one with a tile that is being discarded by another player.
    <br />
    Unlike with a Pong, the player that's discarding the needed tile must be seated to the left of
    the player that's declaring the Chow. <br />
    If a tile is desired by multiple players, a Pong will take precedence over a Chow, otherwise the
    player closest to the discarder gets the tile. <br />
    A Chow that is formed this way must be shown to the other players, whilst a Chow that is formed
    by taking a tile from the wall does not need to be shown.
  </p>

<h4>Kong</h4>
<p>
    A Kong is a set of four consecutive tiles in the same suit. A player can form a Kong by taking a
    tile from the wall or by forming one with a tile that is being discarded by another player.
    <br />
    A Kong that is formed this way must be shown to the other players, whilst a Kong that is formed
    by taking a tile from the wall does not need to be shown. <br />
    Unlike with a Pong or a Chow, a Kong allows the player to draw an extra tile from the end of the
    wall.
  </p>

<h4>Drawing a Flower tile</h4>
<p>
    Whenever a player draws a flower tile, they can replace it with a tile from the end of the wall.
    <br />
    The player can then choose to keep the flower tile to possibly form a Kong or discard it.
  </p>

<h4>Winning</h4>
<p>
    A player can declare a win when they have a winning hand. <br />
    Aside from the four sets, a winning hand must also contain a pair. <br />
    A pair can be completed by drawing a tile from the wall or by forming one with a tile that is
    being discarded by another player. <br />
    The player must then show their winning hand to the other players and claim their win.
