  <h2>Start of the game</h2>
  <p>
    Before the game can begin the players must decide on the seating positions and the dealer. The
    dealer is chosen by rolling the dice and the player with the highest roll becomes the dealer.
    <br />
    Seating positions are important as scoring might depend on it. The four seating posistions are
    equal to the four cardinal directions: North, East, South and West. There are different ways to
    determine the seating positions, but the most common way is to have the dealer sit in the East
    position. Other methods include rolling the dice to determine the seating positions, with the
    highest roll being seated East then South and so on. Or simply assigning the seats randomly.

    The game starts with the tiles being shuffled and built into four walls in the center of the
    table. Each wall is 18 tiles long and 2 tiles high. The walls are then pushed together to form a
    square. Each of the players recieves 13 tiles and the dealer recieves 14 tiles. The dealer then
    discards a tile to start the game.
